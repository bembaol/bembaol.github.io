Hello! I'm a first-year PhD student at [Georgia Tech Internet Intelligence Lab](http://inetintel.org/), co-advised by Prof. Cecilia Testart and Prof. Alberto Dainotti. My research focuses on Internet routing security, with an emphasis on improving the detection and classification of BGP hijacking events. I am an active contributor to the Global Routing Intelligence Platform (https://bgp.live) and contributed to the DFOH system during my Summer 2025 internship (https://https://dfoh.uclouvain.be).

In May 2024, I graduated from my Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech. My thesis was about the investigation of Autonomous Systems recurrently involved in suspicious SubMOAS and MOAS events. I was already co-advised by Prof. Cecilia Testart and Prof. Alberto Dainotti. Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I earned an Engineering Degree from [Telecom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/) in France.
