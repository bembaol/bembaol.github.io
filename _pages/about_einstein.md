Hello! I'm a first-year PhD student at [Georgia Tech Internet Intelligence Lab](http://inetintel.org/), co-advised by Prof. Cecilia Testart and Prof. Alberto Dainotti. My ongoing research is about Internet routing security. In particular, I'm working on improving the classification of MOAS and SubMOAS events in BGP.

In May 2024, I graduated from my Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech. My thesis was about the investigation of Autonomous Systems recurrently involved in suspicious SubMOAS and MOAS events. I was already co-advised by Prof. Cecilia Testart and Prof. Alberto Dainotti. Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I earned an Engineering Degree from [Telecom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/) in France.
