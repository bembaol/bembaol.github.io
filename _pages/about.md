Hello! I'm a first-year PhD student in the [Internet Intelligence Research Lab](http://inetintel.org/) qt Georgiq Tech. I'm co-advised by [Prof. Cecilia Testart](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~ctestart8/) and [Prof. Alberto Dainotti](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~adainotti6/). My ongoing research is about Internet routing security. In particular, I'm working on improving the classification of Multiple Origin AS prefixes (MOAS) and sub prefixes (subMOAS) in BGP, in order to better detect BGP hijacking.

In May 2024, I graduated from my Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech. My thesis was about the investigation of Autonomous Systems recurrently involved in suspicious SubMOAS and MOAS events. I was already co-advised by Prof. Cecilia Testart and Prof. Alberto Dainotti. Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I earned a [Diplôme d'Ingénieur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipl%C3%B4me_d%27Ing%C3%A9nieur) from [Telecom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/en/) in France. As for my undergrad, I did a [Classe Préparatoire aux Grandes Écoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles) in [Faidherbe](https://www.faidherbe.org/).
