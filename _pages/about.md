Hello! I'm a first-year PhD student in the [Internet Intelligence Research Lab](http://inetintel.org/) at Georgia Tech. I'm co-advised by [Prof. Cecilia Testart](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~ctestart8/) and [Prof. Alberto Dainotti](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~adainotti6/). My research focuses on Internet routing security, with an emphasis on improving the detection and classification of BGP hijacking events. I am an active contributor to the [Global Routing Intelligence Platform](https://bgp.live) and contributed to [DFOH](https://https://dfoh.uclouvain.be), a system to detect Forged-Origin BGP Hijacks during my Summer 2025 internship.

In May 2024, I graduated from my Master in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech. My thesis was about the investigation of Autonomous Systems recurrently involved in suspicious SubMOAS and MOAS events. I was already co-advised by Prof. Cecilia Testart and Prof. Alberto Dainotti. Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I earned a [Diplôme d'Ingénieur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipl%C3%B4me_d%27Ing%C3%A9nieur) from [Telecom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/en/) in France. As for my undergrad, I did a [Classe Préparatoire aux Grandes Écoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles) in [Faidherbe](https://www.faidherbe.org/).
