Hello! I'm a first-year PhD student at [Georgia Tech Internet Intelligence Lab](http://inetintel.org/), co-advised by [Prof. Cecilia Testart](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~ctestart8/) and [Prof. Alberto Dainotti](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~adainotti6/). My ongoing research is about Internet routing security. In particular, I'm working on improving the classification of MOAS and SubMOAS events in BGP.

In May 2024, I graduated from my Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech. My thesis was about the investigation of Autonomous Systems recurrently involved in suspicious SubMOAS and MOAS events. I was already co-advised by Prof. Cecilia Testart and Prof. Alberto Dainotti. Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I earned an Engineering Degree from [Telecom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/) in France.
